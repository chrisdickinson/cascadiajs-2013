hi my name is Chris Dickinson and i work 
at Urban Airship in sunny Portland, Oregon.
i'd like to talk to you today about how we interact with our code.

this is some javascript -- this is how we usually see our code.
but there's treachery afoot! this isn't really javascript, it's
text. more than that, it's text that's represented as a series 
of bytes on a hard drive. and that's how we usually interact
with our code, yes?

we search it by entering text and finding lines of other text
that match that text. sometimes, if we're tricky, we'll pull
out a regex and set that to happily nom on our bytes and tell
us where things are -- or change text from one form to another.

but, this is not just text. it's a series of tokens; it's a series
of tokens assembled into a tree, it's a tree that represents instructions,
it's a set of instructions that elicit actions from a virtual machine, 
it's a potential series of actions that cause electrons to hurdle from
one side of a motherboard to another to manipulate a register... ad
infinitum. this text represents many things. each of these views
on this code are true. each view is a different facet of what this
text represents, a different level of abstraction.

what we do when we type text and search text and replace text is a bit
like changing the shape of a shadow to change the shape of a sculpture.

each level of abstraction carries information that the others don't --
each of them is better at expressing certain things than others.

today, I'd like to talk to you about working with your code on a different
layer of abstraction -- at the AST level.
