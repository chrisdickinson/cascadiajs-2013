Once we have an AST, how can we use it?

I personally believe that JavaScript programmers are, amongst their other admirable
traits, uniquely prepared to grapple with the challenge of working with
ASTs, for a couple of reasons.

First, there's a tree structure that very nearly every JavaScript developer
has at least a more than passing familiarity with:

----- click

The DOM. The DOM is a big part of why I think JavaScript developers will
experience a more gradual learning curve when approaching ASTs. The DOM
is many things: it is a tree, it is nested, there are nodes, they have siblings,
they have parents, they have types, and it is complicated. 

You may or may not remember how bad DOM programming used to be.
I won't delve too far into it, but suffice to say, it was bad enough that
JavaScript tried to ease the pain by introducing the "with" statement.

So yeah, it was pretty bad.

Further, the DOM, like the bytes of our JavaScript function versus the 
AST it represents, has a textual counterpart in HTML. HTML creates 
the DOM, and the DOM can produce or accept new HTML to 
produce new DOM structures.

JavaScript as a language and as a community tried many approaches, and
eventually one style clicked: query the tree structure using CSS selectors, and
*consume* what you *output*.
