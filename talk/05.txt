I wrote a module called "CSSauron" that aims to make it
easy to leverage these nice properties against any arbitrary
tree structure. It has a simple API: you give it a definition
of how to find various properties on your particular flavor of
node, and it gives you back a selector compiler.

Prebaked CSSauron modules exist for GLSL, JSON, 
XML, HTML, and, of course, JavaScript.

The node types become tag selectors -- lowercased and abbreviated,
usually, while their relation to their parent node becomes their
"CSS class". Going back to the "if" statement example, "if"'s have
a child node called "test" -- to write a selector that only passes
for nodes that are the "test" of an "if" node, we could write:

    if > .test
